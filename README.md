# Game_Academy_Jam_Price_Of_Death
Here's our little game that we spent a considerable time working on. This game is amongst the 20 that has qualified us to advance to the next phase in Game Academy's game jam, which currently is the biggest of its kind in Turkey. It features two unique levels with differents sets of enemies(that are centered around being melee or ranged) and our hero there to defeat them with his slashing, dashing and blocking powers. It's important to note that this is our very first project coming from 5 sophomore team where we dipped our toes into the gamemaking platform so everything you see here is just the beginning of a soon to blossom artistic talents that hopefully we'll all be able to experience together. We'd like to thank all of the good samatarians out there creating free to use sprites and the sound artists with their beautifully constructed music for the common folk to benefit from, you're the real heroes :) .
